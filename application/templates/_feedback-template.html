<p>I am reviewing my performance over the last while, and would appreciate
  it if you could provide me with any feedback.</p>
<p>Please let me know about any:</p>
<ul>
  <li>things I should do more of</li>
  <li>things I should stop doing</li>
  <li>things I should start doing</li>
  <li>professional skills I displayed or improved</li>
</ul>
<p>Your feedback will be shared with me and my manager, and I am using a
new service that stores it online long-term so I can access it later and
track progress or plan my learning.</p>
<p>You can reply to this email with your feedback or using the link below.</p>
<p>You can also find out more about the new "My Performance" tool here</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
