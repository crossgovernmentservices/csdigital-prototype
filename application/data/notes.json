Distinct user groups responded well others not so well. We’ve been trying to unpick why this was the case and what we should or could take forward into a private beta.\n\nWith CSL we’ve been trying to strip back what they are trying to do. Often rushing a prototype for one thing and moving quickly on to the next. This hasn’t worked and has confused users. So we’ve been designing a really simple journey for a specific task a user has.",
